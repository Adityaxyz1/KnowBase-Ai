Problem Definition & Objective\n**Problem Definition:**\nModern organizations and students deal with large volumes of unstructured information spread across documents, notes, and digital sources. Traditional keyword-based search systems fail to understand semantic meaning, leading to irrelevant or incomplete results.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe objective of KnowBase AI is to design and implement an intelligent knowledge retrieval system that understands user intent, performs semantic search using NLP techniques, and returns contextually relevant answers efficiently."
